I had issue's compiling highchart module on my machine.

3. Implemented service (DI) to perform CRUD operation and fetching the chart data.
4. Implemented a separate module for future scalability. 
5. Applications read's data about dashboard from json file and get's related items.
	--src\assets\json\dashBoard
6. Configuration for each chart and it's datasource is read from json file.
	--src\assets\json\dataSourceCfg
7. All data for graph is stored in json file.
	--src\assets\json\data
8. Configuration data like dashBoard list, dashBoard items list, datasource list, etc is 
   stored using angular-in-memory-web-api.
9. Data for graph is read straight from the files.
10.UI developed using SASS.
